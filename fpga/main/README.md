# The source code for the MAIN module #

This directory contains the VHDL source code for the MAIN module.

This module contains the CPU, RAM, ROM, I/O chips, as well as
performs address decoding of the CPU's memory map.

TBD: So far, there is no support for RAM or ROM banking. This will
be added later.
